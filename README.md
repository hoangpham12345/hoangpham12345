### Hello and welcome everyone who have taken time to see my Github profile  

My name is Pháº¡m Huy HoÃ ng, I am from Vietnam.  
I am a third year student who study Computer Science at International University - HCM National University, Vietnam.  
I am fond of learning new technique and trying to adapt into the project.  
My favorite motto is "Nothing is impossible" which is inspired by Shia Labeouf's motivation speech.  
Although I may be lack of experience but I am very pleased to work with everyone from all over the world.  

ðŸ˜® Fun fact: The only thing your left hand cannot hold but your right hand can is your left elbow.
