### Hello and welcome everyone who have taken time to see my Github profile  

My name is Phạm Huy Hoàng and I am from Vietnam.
I am a third year student who study Computer Science at International University - HCM National University, Vietnam.  
I am fond of learning new technique and trying to adapt into the project.  
Although I may be lack of experience but I am very pleased to work with everyone from all over the world.

😮 Fun fact: At the north pole, the compass needle point to the south toward the north magnetic pole.
